12 On the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat , wearing boots .
13 There , too , was a portrait of a beautiful lady , sound asleep : this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant , also an ancestress of the royal family .
14 Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls .
15 `` You have asked all the right people , my dear ? ''

2 on every seat was a lovely fairy , dressed in green , each with a most interesting-looking parcel in her hand .

5 But the queen , though she saw them distinctly , took no notice of them .
6 You see , she did not believe in fairies , nor in her own eyes , when she saw them .
7 So she talked across the fairies to the king , just as if they had not been there ; but the king behaved as politely as if they were real -- which , of course , they were .
8 When dinner was over , and when the nurse had brought in the baby , all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents .
9 One offered a purse which could never be empty ; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots ; and another a cap of darkness , that nobody might see the prince when he put it on ; and another a wishing-cap ; and another a carpet , on which , when he sat , he was carried wherever he wished to find himself .
10 Another made him beautiful for ever ; and another , brave ; and another , lucky : but the last fairy of all , a cross old thing , crept up and said , `` My child , you shall be too clever ! ''

3 -LCB- Prigio reading a book : p11.jpg -RCB- Indeed , I can not tell you how the prince was hated by all !
4 He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .
5 He would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .
6 He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .
7 He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .
8 The young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? ''
9 and `` Have you read that ? ''
10 -- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .
11 He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .
12 He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !
13 In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
14 And , what was more , he had !
15 As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked .
16 They were not a bit clever , but jolly .
17 Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .
18 Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .
19 Both were in love with two of their own cousins -LRB- with the approval of their dear parents -RRB- ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''
20 But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .
21 Now , as Pantouflia was a rich , lazy XXXXX , which hated fighting , this was very unpleasant , and did not make people love Prince Prigio any better .	country		bit|country|looks|parents|part|people|rage|son|spite|terriers

1 Then he remembered the awful curse of the oldest fairy , and was sorry for the rudeness of the queen .
2 And when the prince , after having his ears boxed , said that `` force was no argument , '' the king went away in a rage .

4 He would go down into the kitchen , and show the cook how to make soup .
5 He would visit the poor people 's cottage , and teach them how to make the beds , and how to make plum-pudding out of turnip-tops , and venison cutlets out of rusty bacon .
6 He showed the fencing-master how to fence , and the professional cricketer how to bowl , and instructed the rat-catcher in breeding terriers .
7 He set sums to the Chancellor of the Exchequer , and assured the Astronomer Royal that the sun does not go round the earth -- which , for my part , I believe it does .
8 The young ladies of the Court disliked dancing with him , in spite of his good looks , because he was always asking , `` Have you read this ? ''
9 and `` Have you read that ? ''
10 -- and when they said they had n't , he sneered ; and when they said they had , he found them out .
11 He found out all his tutors and masters in the same horrid way ; correcting the accent of his French teacher , and trying to get his German tutor not to eat peas with his knife .
12 He also endeavoured to teach the queen-dowager , his grandmother , an art with which she had long been perfectly familiar !
13 In fact , he knew everything better than anybody else ; and the worst of it was that he did : and he was never in the wrong , and he always said , `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
14 And , what was more , he had !
15 As time went on , Prince Prigio had two younger brothers , whom everybody liked .
16 They were not a bit clever , but jolly .
17 Prince Alphonso , the third son , was round , fat , good-humoured , and as brave as a lion .
18 Prince Enrico , the second , was tall , thin , and a little sad , but never too clever .
19 Both were in love with two of their own cousins -LRB- with the approval of their dear parents -RRB- ; and all the world said , `` What nice , unaffected princes they are ! ''
20 But Prigio nearly got the country into several wars by being too clever for the foreign ambassadors .
